This project is an introduction to using the [Requests library][requests] with
the [Wikipedia API][wiki-api] to build data sets and explore them, as a part of
the [Community Data Science Workshops][cdsw] at the
[University of Washington][uw].

The initial work was done by [Mako][mako], however I chose to take the
development of the session in a different direction, to try and de-duplicate as
much as possible. Instead of writing out one long query URL, we build it
piecemeal and then immediately move to using the handy `params` named variable
for the get function in Requests; this way, students see what a query string
looks like and can build one by hand if they ever need to, but they're also
immediately using the tools they'll be using in the future.
